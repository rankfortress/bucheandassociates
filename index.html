	Buche & Associates, P.C. is based in San Diego and also has offices in Los Angeles and Houston.  We handle patent cases that span the country and the world.With decades of experience, the firm is familiar with both patent litigation and patent acquisition.  Our patent attorneys are registered with the United States Patent & Trademark Office.  Importantly, and unlike many other firms, our litigation patent attorneys are registered with the Patent Office, and have experience with patent acquisition so they thoroughly understand the nuanced issues that come up in patent litigation—such as parallel administrative venues, “prior art” issues, patent validity, and administrative patent procedures that affect patent protection.  In many cases, understanding these critical issues can bring a swift resolution to a case that otherwise would have lingered.
	
	Similarly, our patent acquisition attorneys are familiar with patent litigation, and harness that experience to draft the strongest possible patents.  The fact is, not all patents are created equal.  And not all patent attorneys are equal either.  Unless a patent attorney has worked with patent litigation, he or she may not fully grasp what actually makes for a strong patent.  At Buche & Associates, P.C., our patent prosecution attorneys take pride in working to draft patents that are strong, and with claims that were crafted with litigation and/or licensing in mind.Our patent attorneys have considerable experience representing clients from various business and private sectors including oil and gas, medical, fashion, manufacturing, software, sports equipment, appliances, music, tactical systems, and more.  Some samples of the patents that the firm has achieved for its clients can be seen here.
